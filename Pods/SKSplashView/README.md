SKSplashView
============

SKSplashView is a simple class to create beautiful animated splash views for transitioning between views. Perfect as a launch 
screen while your app loads.

The splash view allows you to create an animated background view with preset animations with the option of adding a splash icon
that will animate as long as the splash view is animating.

<h1> Installation </h1>
Adding SKSplashView to your project is super simple.

Simply drag and drop the folder 'SKSplashView' and `#import SKSplashView.h` and you're ready to go.

<h1> Implementation </h1>

<h2> SKSplashView </h2>
Simply create an instance of SKSplashView with the desired customizability option.
```
SKSplashView *splashView = [[SKSplashView alloc] initWithBackgroundColor:[UIColor blueColor] animationType:SKSplashAnimationTypeZoom];
//The SplashView can be initialized with a variety of animation types and backgrounds. See customizability for more.
splashView.animationDuration = 3.0f; //Set the animation duration (Default: 1s)
[self.view addSubview:splashView]; //Add the splash view to your current view
[splashView startAnimation]; //Call this method to start the splash animation
```
The SplashView can also be initialized with the following methods:
```
- (instancetype)initWithAnimationType: (SKSplashAnimationType) animationType;
- (instancetype)initWithBackgroundColor: (UIColor *) backgroundColor animationType: (SKSplashAnimationType) animationType;
- (instancetype)initWithBackgroundImage: (UIImage *) backgroundImage animationType: (SKSplashAnimationType) animationType;
- (instancetype)initWithSplashIcon: (SKSplashIcon *)icon animationType: (SKSplashAnimationType) animationType;
- (instancetype) initWithSplashIcon:(SKSplashIcon *)icon backgroundColor: (UIColor *) backgroundColor animationType:(SKSplashAnimationType) animationType;
- (instancetype) initWithSplashIcon:(SKSplashIcon *)icon backgroundImage:(UIImage *) backgroundImage animationType:(SKSplashAnimationType) animationType;
```

<h4> Customizability </h4>
The appearance of the splash view can be customized with the following properties:
```
@property (strong, nonatomic) UIColor *backgroundViewColor; //Sets the background color of the splash view (Default: white)
@property (strong, nonatomic) UIImage *backgroundImage; //Sets a background image to the splash view
@property (nonatomic, assign) CGFloat animationDuration; //Sets the duration of the splash view
```
The Splash view also allows you to customize the animation transition of the splash view  with the following types:
```
    SKSplashAnimationTypeFade,
    SKSplashAnimationTypeBounce,
    SKSplashAnimationTypeShrink,
    SKSplashAnimationTypeZoom,
    SKSplashAnimationTypeNone,
    SKSplashAnimationTypeCustom
```

<h2> SKSplashIcon </h2>

In addition to adding an animated splash view, you can also add an icon on your splash view with its own customizability options
that will animate as long as the splash view is running.
To add a splash icon to your splash view:

1. `#import SKSplashIcon.h"` in the view you are presenting the splash view

2. Initialize the splash view as follows:
  ```
  SKSplashIcon *splashIcon = [[SKSplashIcon alloc] initWithImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"test.png"] animationType:SKIconAnimationTypeNone]; 
  //Initialize with the customizability option of your choice. See Customizability for more.
  ```
3. Add the splash icon when you are initializing your splash view

  ```
  SKSplashView *splashView = [SKSplashView alloc] initWithSplashIcon:snapchatSplashIcon backgroundColor:snapchatColor animationType:SKSplashAnimationTypeFade];
  ```

You can also add the splash icon when initializing the splash view with the following methods:
```
- (instancetype)initWithSplashIcon: (SKSplashIcon *)icon animationType: (SKSplashAnimationType) animationType;
- (instancetype) initWithSplashIcon:(SKSplashIcon *)icon backgroundColor: (UIColor *) backgroundColor animationType:(SKSplashAnimationType) animationType;
- (instancetype) initWithSplashIcon:(SKSplashIcon *)icon backgroundImage:(UIImage *) backgroundImage animationType:(SKSplashAnimationType) animationType;
```

<h4> Customizability </h4>

The appearance of the splash icon can be customized with the following properties:
```
@property (strong, nonatomic) UIColor *iconColor; //Sets the icon color of the icon (Default: white)
@property (nonatomic, assign) CGSize iconSize; //Sets the size of the icon (Default: 60x60)
```
The animation of the splash icon can also be customized with the following animation types:
```
    SKIconAnimationTypeBounce,
    SKIconAnimationTypeGrow,
    SKIconAnimationTypeShrink,
    SKIconAnimationTypeFade,
    SKIconAnimationTypePing,
    SKIconAnimationTypeBlink,
    SKIconAnimationTypeNone,
    SKIconAnimationTypeCustom
```

<h1> Delegate </h1> 
You can optionally add the SplashView delegate to your view controller to listen to when the splash view begins and ends animating.
To do this:
- Add `<SKSplashDelegate>` to your interface
- Set the delegate to your splash view
  `splashView.delegate = self;`
- Add the following methods to listen to updates
  ```
- (void) splashView:(SKSplashView *)splashView didBeginAnimatingWithDuration:(float)duration
    {
        NSLog(@"Splash view started animating with duration %f", duration);
    }

- (void) splashViewDidEndAnimating:(SKSplashView *)splashView
    {
        NSLog(@"Splash view stopped animating");
    }
```
